1:-Find the time complexity for the code:
    a = 1; 
    b = 1; 
    while(b <= n) 
    {a = a + 1; b = b + a; cout<<"Hi";}

Answer :- The time complexity of a code will be 0(n)

2:-. Find the time complexity for the code snippet:
 for(i = n; i >= 1; i = i/3) 
 cout<<"Hi";

Answer :- The time complexity of a code will be O(logn).
